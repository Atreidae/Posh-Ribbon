# RibbonEdgePsRest
This project is a Powershell module that allow to control Ribbon SBC Edge with REST API.

It has been started by Vikas Jaswal. http://www.allthingsuc.co.uk/about-me/

Seeing the number of people using this Powershell module and making update on their own, I asked Vikas the authorization to post this code on Github to start a collaboration.
This project is completely independent from Ribbon Communication. Ribbon is not responsible for any issue with this module. If you have issue with Ribbon product contact the Ribbon support.

Everyone is free to collaborate on this project or request new feature.

PS: Thanks again Vikas Jaswal for starting this module.
